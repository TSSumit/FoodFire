# _Chapter 01 - Inception_

## Q1: What is `Emmet`?

 `Emmet` is the essential toolkit for web-developers.

It allows you to `type shortcuts` that are then expanded into full pieces of code for writing `HTML and CSS`, based on an abbreviation structure most developers already use that expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.

Eg:

* `div>h1{Hello World}` :  Creates a div containing an h1 tag with the text "Hello World".
* `ul>li*5` :  Generates an unordered list with five list items.

## Q2: Difference between a `Library and Framework`?

* A `library` provides a set of helper `functions/objects/modules` which your application code calls for specific functionality whereas A `framework` is a `structured and reusable architecture` with `predefined components, structures, and patterns` to facilitate application development.
* The major difference between them is the complexity.
* Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code.
* The `framework` provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required.
* Eg- React js is library and Angular is Framework.

## Q: What is `CDN`? Why do we use it?

* A `content delivery network (CDN)` refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
* The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way.

## Q: Why is `React known as React`?

* `React` is named React because of its ability to `react to changes in data`.
* React is called React because it was designed to be a `declarative, efficient, and flexible` JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* The name `React` was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.
* `React` is a `JavaScript-based UI development library`.
* `Facebook` and an `open-source developer community` run it.

## Q: What is `crossorigin in script tag`?

* The `crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
* The purpose of crossorigin attribute is used to share the resources from one domain to another domain.
* Basically, It is used to handle the CORS request that checks whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domains.

### _Syntax_

```sh
<script src="https://example.com/example-framework.js" crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials"></script>
```

## Q: What is difference between `React and ReactDOM`?

* **React**: `React` is a JavaScript library for creating React elements (like  `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, `React.Fragment`, and `React.useState`.)
* **ReactDOM**: `ReactDOM` is also JavaScript library that allows `React to interact with the DOM`. (like `rootElement.append()`)

## Q: What is difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via `CDN`?

* `Development` is the stage of an application before it's made public while `production` is the term used for the same application when it's made `public`.
* developement is best fit for developers as it
* `Development build` is several times (maybe 3-5x) `slower` than the `production build`.

## Q: What is `async and defer`?

* `Async` - The async attribute is a `boolean attribute`.
* The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed as soon` as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and donâ€™t wait for anything.

### _Syntax_

```sh
<script src="demo_async.js" async></script>
```

* `Defer` - The defer attribute is a `boolean attribute`.
* The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed after the page` has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). The `defer attribute` tells the browser `not to wait for the script`. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.

### _Syntax_

```sh
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
```
